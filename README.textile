h1. Campfire Bot

This is a multi-purpose and extensible Campfire bot.  I've forked it to get it running for myself along with some misc clean up.  Notable changes on this branch are:

* Added 'image me' command ala Zach Holman's awesome "automating inefficiencies video":http://zachholman.com/2011/01/automating-inefficiencies/
* Added support for multi-word commands
* Added bundler for dependencies management

If you have suggestions for useful or fun plugins, let me know; I'm always looking for new plugins to add on!
